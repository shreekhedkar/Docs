3. If you installed Node in a different location, you’ll need to set the PATH accordingly.
4. Install Python 2.x. The latest 2.x release available is 2.7.9 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-279/). Get the Windows x86-64 MSI installer or Windows x86 MSI installer, and follow the instructions.
5. Open a command prompt, and type “node”. The node environment should start. Press Ctrl-C to exit.
